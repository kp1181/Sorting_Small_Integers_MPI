# Sorting_Small_Integers_MPI

Implemented an efficient algorithm to sort small integers in distributed memory using Intel MPI without using all-to-all, gather and send-receive operations.

This code was tested and benchmarked on UB's HPC center, [Center for Computational Research](https://www.buffalo.edu/ccr.html).
